## Description

The aim of this project was to add to some pre-existing code, changes that enabled a user to install and use offline an already functioning application.<br> 
The 19th week of coding bootcamp had us learning about progressive web applications and how they can be used to create apps that are platform independant and work offline.<br>
All that was required was to implement the methods for storing data in an IndexedDB database, using the npm package `idb`

#### Usage

The application is very easy to use, all that is required is to visit the webpage and go from there. If the end user so wished, they can install the editor to use offline

If you are seeking to make changes to the code you can first:
- clone the repository
- `cd` into the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run start:dev` for development mode or... 
- `npm run start` to run the application in production mode
